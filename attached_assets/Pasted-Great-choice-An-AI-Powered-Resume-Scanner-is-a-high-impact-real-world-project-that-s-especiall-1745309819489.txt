Great choice! An **AI-Powered Resume Scanner** is a high-impact, real-world project that's especially relevant for HR tech, recruitment platforms, and job portals. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach it:

---

### **Project Title:**
**AI-Powered Resume Shortlisting System Using NLP**

---

### **Objective:**
Automatically screen and rank resumes based on their relevance to a specific job description using Natural Language Processing and machine learning.

---

### **Main Features:**
1. **Upload Resume (PDF/DOCX)**
2. **Input Job Description**
3. **Keyword & Skill Matching**
4. **Score & Rank Resumes**
5. **Display Shortlisted Candidates with Relevance Score**

---

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Streamlit / Flask / React (optional)
- **Backend:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`, `NLTK` – NLP
  - `PyMuPDF` / `pdfminer` / `python-docx` – Resume parsing
  - `TfidfVectorizer` / `BERT` embeddings – Similarity checking
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data processing

---

### **Working Steps:**

1. **Parse and Preprocess Resumes:**
   - Extract text from PDF or DOCX
   - Clean and normalize (remove stopwords, lowercase, etc.)

2. **Extract Key Skills and Keywords:**
   - Use NLP or spaCy's entity recognition
   - Optionally map to standard skills (e.g., from LinkedIn skill taxonomy)

3. **Job Description Parsing:**
   - Extract required skills, roles, and qualifications

4. **Similarity Scoring:**
   - TF-IDF or Sentence Transformers to vectorize text
   - Cosine similarity between resume and job description

5. **Ranking:**
   - Sort resumes based on similarity score
   - Display top N matches

6. **Optional:**
   - Add ML model to learn from past hiring data
   - Include PDF preview and download option for HR users

---

### **Output Example:**
| Candidate Name | Score | Matching Skills         |
|----------------|-------|-------------------------|
| Aakash Verma   | 92%   | Python, ML, SQL         |
| Priya Sharma   | 85%   | Python, Deep Learning   |

---

### **Possible Enhancements:**
- Add chatbot for interaction
- Use BERT for deeper semantic understanding
- Store shortlisted data in a database (Firebase / PostgreSQL)
